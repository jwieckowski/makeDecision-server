The main and primary measure are related to the Euclidean distance of alternatives from the negative-ideal. Using this type of distance requires an -norm indifference space for criteria. The secondary measure is the Taxicab distance, which is related to the -norm indifference space. Clearly, the alternative which has greater distances from the negative-ideal solution is more desirable. In this method, if two alternatives are incomparable according to the Euclidean distance, then the Taxicab distance is used as secondary measure. Although the -norm indifference space is preferred in the CODAS, two types of indifference space could be considered in its process. Based on the assumption that alternatives and criteria are available, the steps of the proposed method can then be presented as follows:"
